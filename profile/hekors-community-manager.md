# Becoming a Community Manager at HEKORS ðŸš€

We really appreciate people who support communities and their initiatives, without thinking about geological borders, gender and domains. At HEKORS we're trying to build a space for people who want to get into tech, learn real engineering principles through many fun initiatives like Hackathons, Open Source Programs and Hands-on activities and sessions.

If you want to become one of the community managers at HEKORS, you can start by applying for your ideal work role through [this volunteer form](https://form.typeform.com/to/LcqR1P0o).
